- Radarr Postgres Database Support
- Radarr Plex Watchlist Support
- Radarr Collections Support
  - Existing Collection Lists have been migrated
- Some users may experience `Database Malformed` or other migration errors
  - This is caused by the database having existing corruption.
  - The solution is to follow the instructions noted on the FAQ for a malformed database. <https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr/faq#i-am-getting-an-error-database-disk-image-is-malformed>
  - Given this just occurred after an update then if the post-migrated database will not open or cannot be recovered then make a copy of the database from a recent backup and apply the database recovery process to that file then try starting Radarr with the recovered backup file.  It should then migrate without issues then.
