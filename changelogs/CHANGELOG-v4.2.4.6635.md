# New Stable Release

Radarr v4.2.4.6635 has been released on `master`

- **Users who do not wish to be on the alpha `nightly` or beta `develop` testing branches should take advantage of this parity and switch to `master`

A reminder about the `develop` and `nightly` branches

- **develop - Current Develop/Beta - (Beta): This is the testing edge. Released after tested in nightly to ensure no immediate issues. New features and bug fixes released here first after nightly. It can be considered semi-stable, but is still beta. This version will receive updates either weekly or biweekly depending on development.**
- **nightly - Current Nightly/Unstable - (Alpha/Unstable) : This is the bleeding edge. It is released as soon as code is committed and passes all automated tests. This build may have not been used by us or other users yet. There is no guarantee that it will even run in some cases. This branch is only recommended for advanced users. Issues and self investigation are expected in this branch. Use this branch only if you know what you are doing and are willing to get your hands dirty to recover a failed update. This version is updated immediately.**

# Announcements

- Radarr Postgres Database Support
- Radarr Plex Watchlist Support
- Radarr Collections Support
  - Existing Collection Lists have been migrated
- Some users may experience `Database Malformed` or other migration errors
  - This is caused by the database having existing corruption.
  - The solution is to follow the instructions noted on the FAQ for a malformed database. <https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr/faq#i-am-getting-an-error-database-disk-image-is-malformed>
  - Given this just occurred after an update then if the post-migrated database will not open or cannot be recovered then make a copy of the database from a recent backup and apply the database recovery process to that file then try starting Radarr with the recovered backup file.  It should then migrate without issues then.
